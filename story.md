A long time ago, in a land far, far away... before death, before time...
===

There was a bow-legged dwarf named Ralph.

The writer created him hoping for a creative character. But sadly he wasn't. Instead he
was a rather poorly created dwarf. Boring and humdrum. In fact there wasn't
anything particularly special about Ralph. Even his dwarven friends
would make fun of him. They called him "Regular Ralph".

But Regular Ralph strived for more. One day he would show them. But the question was, how to become an interesting character? One that can be the main character in a book that would be written about his life. That's something Ralph decided to find out when he started a journey that would hopefully change his life.
