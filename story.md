A long time ago, in a land far, far away... before death, before time...
===

There was a bow-legged dwarf named Ralph.

The writer created him hoping for a creative character. But sadly he wasn't. Instead he
was a rather poorly created dwarf. Boring and humdrum. In fact there wasn't
anything particularly special about Ralph. Even his dwarven friends
would make fun of him. They called him "Regular Ralph".
